## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

This project is an implementation of a GameBoy-inspired gaming console using the STM32 microcontroller and a TFT display.
This Project uses parallel comunication between the TFT screen and STM32 microcontroller.
The games are written in ARM assembly language for optimal performance and low-level hardware control. 
The system features multiple classic arcade games that can be selected from a main menu interface.

## âœ¨ Features

- Custom-built game engine for STM32
- TFT display interface with vibrant colors
- Multiple classic arcade games
- Intuitive menu navigation system
- Efficient assembly language implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Games

### Main Menu

The central hub for game selection, featuring colorful icons for each available game.
